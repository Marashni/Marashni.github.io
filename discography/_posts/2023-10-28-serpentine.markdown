This is the first single for my upcoming LP, 'Anathema'. 
This LP explores more extreme musical territory with Doom and Death Metal influences.

This song (like most songs on this upcoming LP) continues to feature a nylon string guitar at its core, accompanied by a string section for a symphonic death metal feel.
