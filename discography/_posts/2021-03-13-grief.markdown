I'm releasing my debut LP, **Grief**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, on **April 10th, 2021**. 

The material was mostly recorded between 2011-2013, and I've recently used it for learning a new mastering workflow with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my new home studio.

The material was originally intended as a video game soundtrack, and as such, it is instrumental in nature.  The focus is predominantly on electronic instrumentation, although guitars are also featured in the mix. 

**Album List:**  
- Ascension
- Censer
- Forebode
- Insipid Dreams (Pt 1)
- Hollowed
- Severance
- Insipid Dreams (Pt 2)
- Reckoning 
- Desperation
- Sero
- Melatonin
