I'm releasing my second (but debut vocal) album, **Paintings**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, in **August, 2021**. 
It will be available on Spotify, ITunes, and other digital distribution platforms. 

The material was mostly recorded this past year (2020-2021), with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my home studio.

The focus of this album was to predominantly feature nylon (classical/jazz) guitar work, as well as my voice. 
The microphone used for the album was an [S-87](https://microphone-parts.com/collections/microphone-kits/products/s87-microphone-kit) that I soldered together from MicParts. 


**Album List:**  
- Down in a Hole (cover)
- Wicked Game (cover)
- Paintings
- Something in the Way (cover)
- Weak and Powerless (cover)
