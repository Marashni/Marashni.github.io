## Installing YAMon on DD-WRT

I'd like to briefly go over the installation process of **YAMon** on **DD-WRT**. 

The router I'm using for this is a **TP-Link AC1750**, which is running **DD-WRT v3.0-r30731 std (10/06/16)**. 

This guide assumes you are configuring from a Windows system, so if you are using a \*nix system, just substitute the proper \*nix tools in place of **WinSCP** and **PuTTY**.

**Things you will need**:
- **Router running DD-WRT**
* **USB Drive**
* [Installer Script for YAMon v3.3.0](http://usage-monitoring.com/current/YAMon3/install%20(3.3.0).zip)
* [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
* [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) 

### Prepare USB Drive
Your USB Drive needs to be formatted as ext4. There are several ways to do this, if you aren't familiar with this process. Ideally, you're using a \*nix system and can use **GParted**. Alternatively, you can make a [GParted Live USB](http://gparted.org/download.php), or if you absolutely must use Windows, [MiniTool Partition Wizard](https://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html).

### Configure DD-WRT
Once your USB Drive is formatted as ext 4, connect it to your router. 

Login to your router and navigate to the Services tab and the USB sub-tab. 

#### Ensure the following services are enabled:
- **Core USB Support**
* **USB Storage Support**
* **Automatic Drive Mount**

### Install YAMon
Download the YAMon installer script from the link above, expand the zip file, and copy "install.sh" to a local directory. 

#### Launch WinSCP and configure with the following:
- **Set the File protocol to SCP**
* **Set Host name to your Router's Local IP Address**
* **Set Port number to 22**
* **Set User name to root**
* **Set Password to your Router's login password**

#### Login and navigate to the opt folder, then copy "install.sh" to your router.

#### Using the same credentials, launch PuTTY and SSH into the router.

#### At the prompt run the following commands:
- **\`chmod 775 /opt/install.sh\`**
* **\`/opt/install.sh\`**
