I'm releasing my second EP, **Saturnity**, as **Taylor J Hawkins**, on **August 10th, 2022**. 
It will be available on Spotify, ITunes, and other digital distribution platforms. 
The material was recorded this year (2022), with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), my current DAW, in my home studio.

The intention of this EP was to take a further step towards a metal sound with the nylon guitar, more so than with Astral Logical. It was also an exercise in taking a more thoughtful approach compositionally, where I spent more time composing and arranging in [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en), before moving to the DAW.

The microphone used for the EP was an [S-87](https://microphone-parts.com/collections/microphone-kits/products/s87-microphone-kit) that I soldered together from MicParts. 

**EP List:**  
- Orpheus
- Mourning Star
- Saturnity
- The Gods
