Taylor J Hawkins is an American artist that favors the nylon string guitar as his instrument of choice. 
His musical endeavors attempt to showcase the nylon guitar compositionally in solo and band settings. 

He is a big proponent of DIY, and has assembled a small tube amplifier and condenser microphone for performing and recording his craft.

Having been involved in the tech industry since 2007, he is also a big proponent of FOSS and the GNU mindset, which trickles into his musical and digital painting workflows in the studio.

He resides in the Pacific NW where he can be found exploring the great outdoors from the seat of his motorcycle, or alternatively pursuing musical and literary endeavors outside of his day job implementing  and securing cloud infrastructure.  -->
